# TensorFlow Object Detection Workflow using Kubeflow Pipeline

Creating accurate machine learning models capable of localizing and identifying multiple objects in a single image remains a core challenge in computer vision. The TensorFlow Object Detection API is an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection models. At Google weâ€™ve certainly found this codebase to be useful for our computer vision needs, and we hope that you will as well.

* Download coco datasets , mobilenet_v2.ckpt , mscoco_label_map.pbtxt and ssd_mobilenet_v2_320x320_coco17_tpu config from object storage.  
* Train an tensorflow object detection model using coco dataset and ssd_mobilenet_v2_320x320_coco17_tpu configuration.
* Convert the checkpoints to tflite and upload to object storage.
* Serve tflite model using Kubeflow pipeline.
* Perform prediction for a client image request through Jupyter-notebook.
